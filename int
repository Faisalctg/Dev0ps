**Jenkins

3. Apart from these i have experience making the CI/CD as automated by creating the webhooks and make it as event driven. 
4. My CI Pipeline looks like , its a 5 staged pipeline. 
         Stage 1 --> Code Checkout. 
                       - Here we do the Code checkout from the version control
         Stage 2 --> Code Build / Artifact creation. 
                       - This is the Place we do the Artifact creation i.e war/jar/ear/zip/bin etc. 
         Stage 3 --> Upload Artifact 
                       - Here is the Point where we upload the artifact to artifactor like Jfrog artifactory/ Nesus Repository. 
                       - Here we use curl command in a combinatio nwith Authentication token. 
         Stage 4 --> Docker image creation. 
                       - Here we checkout the Dockerfile code from the Devops git and from the artifact that is created in previous step. 
                         we create a docker image from the dockerfile by copying the artifact to the image. 
         Stage 5 --> upload image to the Docker Registry 
                       - Once the image is created , you can upload it to the ECR(AWS-Elastic Container Registry)/ACR(Azure Container Registry)

**Docker & Kubernetes:- 

1. My Responsibility in Docker is to work with Various teams and understand the Application and convert the vm based application to a docker image and scale them and deploy them on the kubernetes cluster like EKS(elastic Kubernetes Service)/AKS(Azure Kubernetes cluster)

2. I have knowledge on Creating Pods, Deployments, Replica sets, Pod Autoscaling , Creating Services (NodePort/CLusterIP/Load Balancer) , Kubernetes cronjob, job etc we can do. 
Apart from this i have good knowledge working with yaml as well.

**Ansible 

1. i have experience working with ANisble , Ansible is used in our case for both configuration Management and Application Automation. 
COnfiguration Management - if we want to change a one simple file like server.xml in tomcat for 100 servers, you need a powerful config mgmt tool to help you 
                           Ansbile can be used in this case. 
Application Automation -  we use this to deploy using jenkins , we use this for Creating Playboooks to install and configure the application and do the builds.
